# Veggiemon-Grow

Veggiemon-Grow is an app that promotes kids to eat healthier and get them involved in outdoor activities. Kids can scan barcodes of healthy items in a store and potentially find a Veggiemon to battle! If they spend time at a local park or farmers market, they can earn more points to upgrade their Veggiemon. It was meant to be viewed on mobile devices.

You can check out the live version [here] (http://veggiemongrow2016.herokuapp.com/).
